`MyoSuite` is a collection of musculoskeletal environments and tasks simulated with the [MuJoCo](http://www.mujoco.org/) physics engine and wrapped in the OpenAI ``gym`` API to enable the application of Machine Learning to bio-mechanic control problems.

 [Full task details](https://github.com/facebookresearch/myosuite/blob/main/docs/source/suite.rst#tasks) | [Baselines](https://github.com/facebookresearch/myosuite/tree/main/myosuite/agents/baslines_NPG) | [Documentation](https://myosuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
| [Tutorials](https://github.com/facebookresearch/myosuite/tree/main/docs/source/tutorials)

Below is an overview of the tasks in the MyoSuite.

## Getting Started
You will need Python 3.8 or later versions. At this moment, the library has been tested **only on MacOs and Linux** with [MuJoCo v2.1.0](https://github.com/deepmind/mujoco/releases/tag/2.1.0).

It is recommended to use [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links) and to create a separate environment with:
``` bash
conda create --name myosuite python=3.8
conda activate myosuite
```

It is possible to install MyoSuite with:
``` bash
pip install -U myosuite
```
for advanced installation, see [here](setup/README.md).

Test your installation using the following command (this will return also a list of all the current environments):
``` bash
python -m myosuite.tests.test_myo
```

You can also visualize the environments with random controls using the command below:
``` bash
python -m myosuite.utils.examine_env --env_name myoElbowPose1D6MRandom-v0
```
**NOTE:** If the visualization results in a GLFW error, this is because `mujoco-py` does not see some graphics drivers correctly. This can usually be fixed by explicitly loading the correct drivers before running the python script. See [this page](setup/README.md#known-issues) for details.

## Examples
It is possible to create and interface with MyoSuite environments just like any other OpenAI gym environments. For example, to use the `myoElbowPose1D6MRandom-v0` environment, it is possible simply to run: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U6vo6Q_rPhDaq6oUMV7EAZRm6s0fD1wn?usp=sharing)


```python
import myosuite
import gym
env = gym.make('myoElbowPose1D6MRandom-v0')
env.reset()
for _ in range(1000):
  env.sim.render(mode='window')
  env.step(env.action_space.sample()) # take a random action
env.close()
```

You can find [tutorials](https://github.com/facebookresearch/myosuite/tree/main/docs/source/tutorials#tutorials) on how to load MyoSuite models/tasks, train them, and visualize their outcome. Also, you can find [baselines](https://github.com/facebookresearch/myosuite/tree/main/myosuite/agents) to test some pre-trained policies.
