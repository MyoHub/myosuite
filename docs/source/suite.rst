Models
********

MyoSuite consists of three models: :ref:`myoFinger`, :ref:`myoElbow` and :ref:`myoHand`.
Using these models we design a rich collection of tasks ranging from simple reaching movements
to contact-rich movements like pen-twirling and baoding balls.


.. _myoFinger:

myoFinger
==========
Simplified and intuitive model (based on Xu et al. (2012)) of a 4 Degree of Freedom (DoF) finger
which is actuated through a series of 5 simplified antagonistic muscle-tendon units.
We also provide its robotic counterpart with simple torque actuators
to facilitate the comparative investigation.

.. _myoElbow:

myoElbow
===========
A model of 2 DoF human elbow joint -- based on OpenSim’s default testing arm model (Delp et al. (2007); Seth et al. (2018))
-- and actuated using multiple agonist/antagonist pairs (3 flexors and 3 extensors).

:ref:`myoElbow` model with 6 muscles (3 flexors and 3 extensors) was simplified to have only elbow rotations.
Although it is not a physiologically accurate model it can be a very simple model for troubleshooting initial control schemes.

    - **Hard**: Move to random joint poses using 6 muscles ``myoElbowPose1D6MRandom-v0``

.. image:: images/elbow_joint_pose.png
  :width: 200

Hand Joints Pose
=====================
Drive the :ref:`myoHand` model to achieve a joint poses.
In addition to making co-ordinated movements, avoiding self collisions poses additional challenges in solving this task.

Objective:
    Strike a hand pose

Variants:
    - **Easy**: Move to a fixed joint pose ``myoHandPoseFixed-v0``
    - **Hard**: Move to a randomly selected joint pose ``myoHandPoseRandom-v0``
    - **More**: Random resets, no resets, dense rewards, sparse rewards

.. image:: images/hand_joint_pose.png
  :width: 200


Hand Tips Reach
=====================
Make reaching movements using the :ref:`myoHand` model to have finger tips achieve a specific spatial position.
In addition to making co-ordinated movements, avoiding self collisions poses additional challenges in solving this task.

Objective:
    Reach using finger tips

Variants:
    - **Easy**: Reach fixed positions using finger tips ``myoHandReachFixed-v0``
    - **Hard**: Reach random positions using finger tips ``myoHandReachRandom-v0``
    - **More**: Random resets, no resets, dense rewards, sparse rewards

.. image:: images/hand_tip_reach.png
  :width: 200


Hand Key Turn
==============
Use the the :ref:`myoHand` model to rotate a key.
The complexity of this task is due to the use of only index and thumb fingers to solve the task with intermittent contact
with the key.

Objective:
    Coordinate finger movements to rotate a key

Variants:
    - **Easy**: Achieve half rotation of the key ``myoHandKeyTurnFixed-v0``
    - **Hard**: Achieve full rotation + random initial configuration ``myoHandKeyTurnRandom-v0``
    - **More**: Random resets, no resets, dense rewards, sparse rewards

.. image:: images/hand_key_turn.png
  :width: 200


Hand Object Hold
=====================
A :ref:`myoHand` model moves an object in the hand to a given orientation without dropping it.
The complexity of this task is due to the intermittent contacts between the object and multiple fingers needing co-ordination to stabilize the object.

Objective:
    Reposition an object to reach a given target without dropping it.

Variants:
    - **Easy**: Reposition to a fixed position ``myoHandObjHoldFixed-v0``
    - **Hard**: Reposition a random object to random positions ``myoHandObjHoldRandom-v0``
    - **More**: sparse rewards, dense rewards, random resets, reset free

.. image:: images/hand_object_hold.png
  :width: 200

Hand Pen Twirl
==============
A :ref:`myoHand` model rotate a pen in the hand to a given orientation without dropping it.
The complexity of this task is due to the intermittent contacts between the object and multiple fingers while trying to stabilize the object.

Objective:
    Rotate the object to reach a given orientation (indicated by the green object in the scene) without dropping it.

Variants:
    - **Easy**: Rotate to fixed orientation ``myoHandPenTwirlFixed-v0``
    - **Hard**: Rotate of random orientation ``myoHandPenTwirlRandom-v0``
    - **More**: sparse rewards, dense rewards, random resets, reset free

  :width: 200

Hand Baoding Balls
=====================
A :ref:`myoHand` model involved for simultaneous rotation of two free-floating spheres over the palm.
This task requires both dexterity and coordination.

Objective:
    Achieve relative rotation of the balls around each other without dropping them.

Action Space:
    The whole set of muscle [0, 1]

Observation Space:
    All joints angles [-:math:`\pi`, :math:`\pi`]


Variants:
    - **Easy**: Swap the position of the balls ``myoChallengeBaodingP1-v1``
    - **Hard**: Achieve contineous rotations ``myoChallengeBaodingP2-v1``
    - **More**: Sparse rewards, 3 different dense reward options to choose from

Non-stationarities task variations
***********************************


.. _sarcopenia:

Sarcopenia
==============

Sarcopenia is a muscle disorder that occurs commonly in the elderly population (Cruz-Jentoft and Sayer (2019))
and characterized by a reduction in muscle mass or volume.
The peak in grip strength can be reduced up to 50% from age 20 to 40 (Dodds et al. (2016)).
We modeled sarcopenia for each muscle as a reduction of 50% of its maximal isometric force.


.. _fatigue:

Fatigue
============================
Muscle Fatigue is a short-term (second to minutes) effect that happens after sustained or repetitive voluntary movement
and it has been linked to traumas e.g. cumulative trauma disorder (Chaffin et al. (2006)).
A dynamic muscle fatigue model (Ma et al. (2009)) was integrated into the modeling framework.
This model was based on the idea that different types of muscle fiber that have different contributions
and resistance to fatigue (Vøllestad (1997)).
The current implementation is simplified to consider the same fatigue factor for all muscles and
that muscle can be completely fatigued.

.. _ttransfer:

Tendon transfer
================
Contrary to muscle fatigue or sarcopenia that occurs to all muscles, tendon transfer surgery can target a single
muscle-tendon unit. Tendon transfer surgery allows redirecting the application point of muscle forces from one joint
DoF to another (see below). It can be used to regain functional control of a joint or limb motion after injury.
One of the current procedures in the hand is the tendon transfer of Extensor Indicis Proprius (EIP) to replace the
Extensor Pollicis Longus (EPL) (Gelb (1995)). Rupture of the EPL can happen after a broken wrist and create a loss of control
of the Thumb extension. We introduce a physical tendon transfer where the EIP application point of the tendon was moved
from the index to the thumb and the EPL was removed (see Figure 3).

.. _exo:

Exoskeleton assistance
======================
Exoskeleton assisted rehabilitation is becoming more and more common practice (Jezernik et al. (2003)) due to its multiple benefit (Nam et al. (2017)).
Modeling of an exoskeleton for the elbow was done via an ideal actuator and the addition of two supports with a weight of 0.101 Kg for the upper arm and 0.111 Kg on the forearm. The assistance given by the exoskeleton was a percentage of the biological joint torque, this was based on the neuromusculoskeletal controller presented in Durandau et al. (2019).
